## Single Perceptrone ANN
First step towards Deep learning
Trying to explain single perceptrone neural network by fashion mnist dataset
1. Load data by keras
2. Contain 70000 images and labels from 0 to 9
3. Labels defines the different classes of images
- 0 -> T-shirt/top
- 1 -> Trouser
- 2 -> Pullover
- 3 -> Dress
- 4 -> Coat
- 5 -> Sandal
- 6 -> Shirt
- 7 -> Sneaker
- 8 -> Bag
- 9 Ankle boot
4. Train test splitting of Dataset 60000 Training data and 10000 Testing Data
5. Apply the sequential model
- Input layer
- Hidden layer
- Output layer
6. Compilation and model fitting
7. Prediction on Test data
8. Accuracy of model
